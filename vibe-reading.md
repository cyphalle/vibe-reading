- Identify main parts/sections and chapter breakdown
- Understand target audience and book's scope

### Step 2: Chapter Deep-Dive Analysis
For each chapter, follow this structure:

#### A. Summary
- 2-3 sentence overview of the chapter's main argument
- Context within the broader book framework

#### B. Key Quotes
- Extract 2-3 most impactful quotes that capture core concepts
- Use block quotes for emphasis
- Focus on actionable insights or memorable principles

#### C. Key Takeaways  
- List 3-5 main concepts in bullet format
- Focus on principles that can be applied practically
- Distill complex ideas into simple, memorable points

#### D. Application to Your Context
- Relate insights to your specific business situation
- Break down into:
  - **Immediate Actions**: What you can do right now
  - **Strategic Considerations**: Longer-term implications  
  - **Context-Specific Applications**: How it applies to your industry/stage
  - **Questions to Consider**: Thought-provoking questions for deeper reflection
