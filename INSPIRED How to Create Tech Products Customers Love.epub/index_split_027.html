Realize that typical product roadmaps are all about </span><span class="italic">output</span><span class="calibre_3">. Yet, good teams are asked to deliver </span><span class="italic">business results</span><span class="calibre_3">.</span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">Most of the product world has the same definition for product roadmap, but there are a few variations. I define </span><span class="italic">product roadmap</span><span class="calibre_3"> as a </span><span class="italic">prioritized list of features and projects</span><span class="calibre_3"> your team has been asked to work on. These product roadmaps are usually done on a quarterly basis, but sometimes they are a rolling three months, and some companies do annual roadmaps.</span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">In some cases, product roadmaps come down from management (usually referred to as a </span><span class="italic">stakeholder‐driven roadmap</span><span class="calibre_3">) and sometimes the roadmap comes from the product manager. They don't usually include little things like bugs and optimizations, but they do normally contain the requested features, projects, and big, multi‐team efforts often called </span><span class="italic">initiatives</span><span class="calibre_3">. And they typically include due dates or at least time frames for when each item is expected to be delivered.</span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">Management knows that many parts of the company need things from the product organization; yet, we are rarely staffed to be able to do everything that's needed. So, management may help mediate this battle over the constrained resources. That's where stakeholder‐driven roadmaps are especially common.</span></p><blockquote class="calibre_4"><span class="italic">Typical roadmaps are the root cause of most waste and failed efforts in product organizations.</span></blockquote><p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre_3">Management has fair reasons for wanting product roadmaps:</span></p><div class="calibre_12"> </div><ul class="calibre_24"><li value="1" class="calibre_14">First, they want to be sure you're working on the highest‐value things first.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_14">Second, they are trying to run a business, which means they need to be able to plan. They want to know when key capabilities will launch so they can coordinate marketing programs, sales force hiring, dependencies with partners, and so on.</li><a></a></ul><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">These are reasonable desires. Yet, typical roadmaps are the root cause of most waste and failed efforts in product organizations.</span><a></a></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">Let's explore why product roadmaps are such a problem, and then let's consider the alternatives.</span></p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_27"></div>
