</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">An opportunity assessment is an extremely simple technique but can save you a lot of time and grief.</span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">The idea is to answer four key questions about the discovery work you are about to undertake:</span></p><div class="calibre_12"> </div><ol class="calibre_13"><li value="1" class="calibre_14">What business objective is this work intended to address? (<span class="italic">Objective</span>)</li><li value="2" class="calibre_14">How will you know if you've succeeded? (<span class="italic">Key results</span>)</li><li value="3" class="calibre_14">What problem will this solve for our customers? (<span class="italic">Customer problem</span>)</li><li value="4" class="calibre_14">What type of customer are we focused on? (<span class="italic">Target market</span>)</li></ol><p class="calibre_1">
</p><p id="filepos338134" class="calibre_18"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">Business Objective</span></span></p><p class="calibre_11"><span class="calibre_3">The first question should map to one or more of your team's assigned objectives. For example, if you've been asked to focus on the problem of growth, to reduce the time it takes for a new customer to onboard, or to reduce the percentage of customers that churn each month, then we want to be clear that this work will address at least one of our assigned problems.</span></p><p class="calibre_1">
</p><p id="filepos338702" class="calibre_18"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">Key Results</span></span></p><p class="calibre_11"><span class="calibre_3">We want to know at the outset what the measure of success is. For example, if we're trying to reduce churn, would a 1 percent improvement be considered excellent or would be it be considered a waste of time? The second question should map to at least one of the </span><a></a><span class="italic">key results</span><span class="calibre_3"> assigned to our product team.</span></p><p class="calibre_1">
</p><p id="filepos339247" class="calibre_18"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">Customer Problem</span></span></p><blockquote class="calibre_4"><span class="italic">We want to keep the focus on our customers.</span></blockquote><p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre_3">Everything we do is, of course, intended to benefit our own company in some way or we wouldn't do it. But we want to keep the focus on our customers, and this question will clearly articulate the problem we want to solve for our customers. We occasionally do something to help internal users, so if that's the case we can call that out here. But even then, we try to tie it back to the benefits to our end customers.</span></p><p class="calibre_1">
</p><p id="filepos339977" class="calibre_18"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">Target Market</span></span></p><p class="calibre_11"><span class="calibre_3">So much product work fails because it tries to please everyone and ends up pleasing no one. This question is intended to make it very clear to the product team who the primary intended beneficiary of this work is. Normally, this is a particular type of user or customer. It might be described as a user or customer persona, a specific target market, or a specific job to be done.</span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">There are other factors you may want to consider when assessing an opportunity, depending on the nature of the opportunity, but I consider these four questions to be the bare minimum. You need to ensure that every member of your product team knows and understands the answers to these four questions before you jump into your product discovery work.</span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">Answering these questions is the responsibility of the product manager, and it normally takes a few minutes to prepare these answers. But then the product manager needs to share them with her product team and with key stakeholders to ensure you are on the same page.</span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">One important caveat: Sometimes the CEO or another senior leader will explain that there's something beyond normal product work that needs to be done. Realize that there are sometimes strategic reasons for doing specific product work, such as support a partnership. If it happens a lot, then that's a different issue, but it's usually infrequent. If that's the case, don't stress over it. Just give the team as much context as you can—these four questions may still be relevant.</span><a></a></p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_47"></div>
