</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">Many product teams want to move off product roadmaps, but their organizations are old school, addicted to the outdated quarterly product roadmap. As a result, they don't see how to transition their organizations forward.</span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">Here's what I advocate in this case: Plan to continue with your existing roadmap process for six to 12 months. However, starting immediately, every time you reference a product roadmap item, or discuss it in a presentation or meeting, be sure to include a reminder of the actual </span><span class="italic">business outcome</span><span class="calibre_3"> that feature is intended to help.</span></p><blockquote class="calibre_4"><span class="italic">The goal is that over time, the organization moves its focus from specific features launching on specific dates to business results.</span></blockquote><p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre_3">If the feature you're working on is to add PayPal as a payment method, and the reason is to increase conversion, then be sure to always show the current conversion rate and the result you're hoping to achieve. Most important, after the feature goes live, be sure to highlight the impact on that conversion rate.</span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">If the impact was good, celebrate it. If the impact was not what was hoped, then emphasize to everyone that, while you did ship the feature, the result was not successful. Point out specifically what was learned, but explain that you have other ideas for ways to get the desired result.</span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">The goal is that over time (it can take as long as a year), the organization moves its focus from specific features launching on specific dates to business results.</span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">For this to work, it's important to acknowledge the two big reasons why stakeholders especially are so attracted to roadmaps:</span></p><div class="calibre_12"> </div><ol class="calibre_13"><li value="1" class="calibre_14">They want some visibility into what you are working on and assurance that you are working on the most important items.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_14">They want to be able to plan the business and need to know when critical things will happen.</li></ol><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">The modern alternative to roadmaps discussed here addresses both of these concerns. Teams work on the prioritized business objectives determined by the leaders; we share our key results transparently; and we commit to high‐integrity commitments when critical delivery dates are needed.</span><a></a></p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_77"></div>
