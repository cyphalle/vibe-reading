</p><p id="filepos264379" class="calibre_18"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">Overview</span></span></p><p class="calibre_11"><span class="calibre_3">I was extremely fortunate to have started my career at HP as an engineer during their heyday, when they were known as the industry's most successful and enduring example of consistent innovation and execution.</span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">As part of HP's internal engineering management training program called </span><span class="italic">The HP Way</span><span class="calibre_3">, I was introduced to a business objective–based system known as MBO—</span><span class="italic">management by objectives</span><span class="calibre_3">.</span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">Dave Packard claimed: “No [tool] has contributed more to Hewlett‐Packard's success. [MBO] is the antithesis of management by control.”</span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">The MBO system was refined and improved at several companies over the years, most notably by the legendary Andy Grove at Intel. Today, the primary business objective management system we use is known as the OKR system—</span><span class="italic">objectives and key results</span><span class="calibre_3">.</span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">John Doerr brought the technique from Intel to a very young Google, and a couple decades after Dave Packard attributed much of HP's success to MBO, Larry Page said essentially the same thing about the importance of the OKR process on Google's success.</span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">The concept is straightforward and based on two fundamental principles:</span></p><div class="calibre_12"> </div><ol class="calibre_13"><li value="1" class="calibre_14">The first can easily be summed up with the famous General George Patton quote I mentioned earlier: “Never tell people how to do things. Tell them what to do, and they will surprise you with their ingenuity.”</li><li value="2" class="calibre_14">The second was captured by HP's tagline of that era: “When performance is measured by results.” The idea here is that you can release all the features you want, but if it doesn't solve the underlying business problem, you haven't really solved anything.</li></ol><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">The first principle is fundamentally about how to empower and motivate people to get them to do their best work, and the second is about how to meaningfully measure progress.</span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">So much has changed in our industry over the years, but these two fundamental management principles are still at the foundation of how the best tech companies and teams operate.</span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">While there are several workable systems and tools for managing these business objectives, in this book, I'll focus on the OKR system technique. Most of the major successful tech companies have been using it for several years now. It seems to have hit some sort of tipping point and is now spreading globally.</span><a></a></p><blockquote class="calibre_4"><span class="italic">The first principle is fundamentally about how to empower and motivate people to get them to do their best work, and the second is about how to meaningfully measure progress.</span></blockquote><p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre_3">While the concept of team objectives might sound straightforward, there are many ways to institutionalize this across product teams and organizations, and it can take a few quarters before the organization finds its groove.</span></p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_35"></div>
