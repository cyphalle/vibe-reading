</p><p id="filepos413906" class="calibre_18"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">Overview</span></span></p><p class="calibre_11"><span class="calibre_3">Prototypes of various forms have been around for as long as we've been applying technology to solve problems. Per the famous Fred Brooks quote, “Plan to throw one away; you will, anyhow.”</span></p><blockquote class="calibre_4"><span class="italic">“Plan to throw one away; you will, anyhow.”</span></blockquote><p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre_3">While Fred's quote is as relevant today as when it was first published (in 1975!), many things have changed, not the least of which is that the tools and techniques we have for developing prototypes and testing them have progressed dramatically.</span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">That said, I continue to find teams, and even people I would consider thought leaders, that have a very narrow interpretation of what is meant by the term </span><span class="italic">prototype</span><span class="calibre_3">.</span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">When I press people, what I typically find is that they associate the term prototype with the type that they were first exposed to. If the first one you saw was used to test for feasibility, that's what you think of. If the first one you saw was used for usability testing, that's what you think of.</span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">But there are in fact many very different forms of prototypes, each with different characteristics and each suited to testing different things. And, yes, some people get themselves into trouble trying to use the wrong type of prototype for the job at hand.</span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">In this overview, I highlight the major classes of prototypes, and in the chapters that follow, I go into depth on each of them.</span></p><p class="calibre_1">
</p><p id="filepos415854" class="calibre_18"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">Feasibility Prototypes</span></span></p><p class="calibre_11"><span class="calibre_3">These are written by engineers to address technical feasibility risks during product discovery—before we decide whether something is feasible. Sometimes, the engineers are trying out a new technology. Sometimes it's a new algorithm. Often it is about assessing performance. The idea is for the developer to write just enough code to be able to address the feasibility risk.</span></p><p class="calibre_1">
</p><p id="filepos416437" class="calibre_18"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">User Prototypes</span></span></p><p class="calibre_11"><span class="calibre_3">User prototypes are simulations. There is a wide spectrum of user prototypes—from those intentionally designed to look like wireframes sketched out on paper (referred to as </span><a></a><span class="italic">low‐fidelity user prototypes</span><span class="calibre_3">) all the way up to those that look and feel like the real thing (referred to as </span><span class="italic">high‐fidelity user prototypes</span><span class="calibre_3">), where it can be difficult to tell it's just a simulation.</span></p><p class="calibre_1">
</p><p id="filepos417098" class="calibre_18"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">Live‐Data Prototypes</span></span></p><p class="calibre_11"><span class="calibre_3">Live‐data prototypes are a little more complicated to explain, but they are a critically important tool for several situations. The main purpose of a </span><span class="italic">live‐data prototype</span><span class="calibre_3"> is to collect actual data so we can prove something, or at least gather some evidence—normally to find out whether an idea (a feature, a design approach, a workflow) really works. This typically means two things. First, we need the prototype to access our live data sources, and second, we need to be able to send live traffic—in enough quantity to get some useful data—to the prototype.</span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">The key is that we don't want to have to build, test, and deploy a commercially viable product to do this. That would take far too long, cost far too much, and very likely yield huge waste. A live‐data prototype costs a small fraction of what it would cost to build a commercially viable product, which is what makes this such a powerful tool.</span></p><p class="calibre_1">
</p><p id="filepos418319" class="calibre_18"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">Hybrid Prototypes</span></span></p><p class="calibre_11"><span class="calibre_3">There are also many hybrids, which combine aspects of the other types. For example, when working on search and recommendations in which we're focusing on relevance, we may need to have the prototype access live‐data sources, but we don't need to be able to send live traffic. In this case, we're not trying to prove anything, but we can learn a great deal by observing and discussing the results with the users.</span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">Remember that product discovery is all about coming up with the fastest, cheapest way to test out our ideas. So, depending on your particular idea and situation, you'll want to pick the flavor of prototype that best meets your needs.</span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">While we all might have our favorites, if you are competing against good product teams, you are going to need to be skilled at each of these.</span><a></a></p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_59"></div>
