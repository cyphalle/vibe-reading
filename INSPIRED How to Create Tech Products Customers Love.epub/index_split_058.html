</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">There are many variations of hack days, but in this chapter, I describe one of my favorite techniques to quickly get a range of high‐potential ideas that are focused on solving a pressing business or customer problem.</span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">The two main types of hack days are directed and undirected. In an </span><span class="italic">undirected</span><span class="calibre_3"> hack day, people can explore whatever product ideas they like, so long as it's at least loosely related to the mission of the company.</span></p><blockquote class="calibre_4"><span class="italic">This is one of my favorite techniques for building a team of missionaries rather than mercenaries.</span></blockquote><p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre_3">In a </span><span class="italic">directed</span><span class="calibre_3"> hack day, there's a customer problem (for example, something is really difficult to learn and use, or it takes too long to do) or business objective we've been assigned (for example, “Reduce the customer churn rate” or “Increase customer lifetime value”), and we ask people from the product teams to self‐organize and work on any ideas they like that might address this objective.</span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">The goal is for the self‐organizing groups to explore their ideas and create some form of prototype that can be evaluated, and if appropriate, tested on actual users.</span><a></a></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">There are two major benefits to these directed hack days. The first is practical, as the technique facilitates the inclusion of engineers at ideation. I've mentioned several times in this book that many of the best ideas come from the engineers on the team, and we need to ensure this is happening. It should be happening on an ongoing basis, but this technique will ensure it happens.</span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">The second benefit is cultural. This is one of my favorite techniques for building a team of missionaries rather than mercenaries. The engineers, if they haven't already, are now diving much deeper into the business context and playing a much larger role in terms of innovation.</span></p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_58"></div>
