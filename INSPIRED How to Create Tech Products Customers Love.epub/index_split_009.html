</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">In this book, I refer to a set of concepts that form the foundation of modern product work. I'd like to briefly explain them here.</span></p><p class="calibre_1">
</p><p id="filepos47456" class="calibre_18"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">Holistic Product</span></span></p><p class="calibre_11"><span class="calibre_3">I have already been using the term </span><span class="italic">product</span><span class="calibre_3"> pretty loosely. I did say I'm only talking about technology‐powered products. But, more generally, when I refer to product I mean a very holistic definition of product.</span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">This certainly includes the </span><span class="italic">functionality</span><span class="calibre_3">—the features.</span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">But it also includes the </span><span class="italic">technology</span><span class="calibre_3"> that enables this functionality.</span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">It also includes the </span><span class="italic">user experience design</span><span class="calibre_3"> that presents this functionality.</span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">And it includes how we </span><span class="italic">monetize</span><span class="calibre_3"> this functionality.</span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">It includes how we attract and </span><span class="italic">acquire users and customers</span><span class="calibre_3">.</span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">And it can also include </span><span class="italic">offline experiences</span><span class="calibre_3"> as well that are essential to delivering the product's value.</span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">If, for example, your product is an e‐commerce site, then this would include the merchandise‐fulfillment experience and the merchandise‐return experience. In general, for e‐commerce businesses, product includes everything </span><span class="italic">except</span><span class="calibre_3"> the actual merchandise being sold.</span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">Similarly, for a media company, we refer to the product as everything except the content.</span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">The point is to have a very inclusive and holistic definition of </span><span class="italic">product</span><span class="calibre_3">. You are not just concerned with implementing features.</span></p><p class="calibre_1">
</p><p id="filepos49685" class="calibre_18"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">Continuous Discovery and Delivery</span></span></p><p class="calibre_11"><span class="calibre_3">I explained previously that most companies still have a process that is essentially waterfall at its core, and I told you that what we do in a modern team is very different.</span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">We'll be going more into the product development process later, but I do need to introduce a high‐level concept about process at this point in our discussion. That is, there are two essential high‐level activities in all product teams. </span><span class="italic">We need to discover the product to be built, and we need to deliver that product to market</span><span class="calibre_3">.</span></p><p class="calibre_7"><img src="images/00004.jpg" class="calibre_19"/>
</p><p id="filepos50580" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_10">FIGURE 8.1</span></span><span class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre_10"> Continuous Discovery and Delivery</span></span></p><p class="calibre_11"><span class="calibre_3">Discovery and delivery are our two main activities on a cross‐functional product team, and they are both typically ongoing and in parallel.</span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">There are several ways to think about this and to visualize it, but the concept is fairly simple: We are always working in parallel to both </span><span class="italic">discover</span><span class="calibre_3"> the necessary product to be built—which is primarily what the product manager and designer work on every day—while the engineers work to </span><span class="italic">deliver</span><span class="calibre_3"> production‐quality product.</span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">Now, as you'll soon see, it's a little more involved than that. For example, the engineers are also helping daily on discovery (and many of the best innovations come from that participation, so this is not a minor point), and the product manager and designer are also helping daily on delivery (mainly to clarify intended behavior). But this is what's going on at a high level.</span></p><blockquote class="calibre_4"><span class="italic">We need to discover the product to be built, and we need to deliver that product to market.</span></blockquote><p class="calibre_20">
</p><p id="filepos52086" class="calibre_18"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">Product Discovery</span></span></p><p class="calibre_11"><span class="calibre_3">Discovery is very much about the intense collaboration of product management, user experience design, and engineering. In discovery, we are tackling the various risks before we write even one line of production software.</span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">The purpose of product discovery is to quickly separate the good ideas from the bad. The output of product discovery is a </span><span class="italic">validated product backlog</span><span class="calibre_3">.</span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">Specifically, this means getting answers to four critical questions:</span></p><div class="calibre_12"> </div><ol class="calibre_13"><li value="1" class="calibre_14">Will the user buy this (or choose to use it)?</li><li value="2" class="calibre_14">Can the user figure out how to use this?</li><li value="3" class="calibre_14">Can our engineers build this?</li><li value="4" class="calibre_14">Can our stakeholders support this?</li></ol><p class="calibre_1">
</p><p id="filepos53323" class="calibre_18"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">Prototypes</span></span></p><p class="calibre_11"><span class="calibre_3">Product discovery involves running a series of very quick experiments, and to do these experiments quickly and inexpensively, we use </span><span class="italic">prototypes</span><span class="calibre_3"> rather than products. At this point, let me just say that there are several types of prototypes, each for different risks and situations, but they all require </span><span class="italic">at least</span><span class="calibre_3"> an order of magnitude of less time and effort than building a product.</span></p><blockquote class="calibre_4"><span class="italic">To set your expectations, strong teams normally test many product ideas each week—on the order of 10 to 20 or more per week.</span></blockquote><p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre_3">To set your expectations, strong teams normally test many product ideas each week—on the order of 10 to 20 or more per week.</span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">I want to emphasize that these are experiments, typically run using prototypes. A prototype is not something that's ready for prime time and certainly not something your company would try to sell and stand behind. But they're immensely useful, as they're all about learning fast and cheap.</span></p><p class="calibre_1">
</p><p id="filepos54714" class="calibre_18"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">Product Delivery</span></span></p><p class="calibre_11"><span class="calibre_3">The purpose of all these prototypes and experiments in discovery is to quickly come up with something that provides some evidence it is worth building and that we can then deliver to our customers.</span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">This means the necessary scale, performance, reliability, fault tolerance, security, privacy, internationalization, and localization have been performed, and the product works as advertised.</span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">The purpose of product delivery is to build and deliver these production‐quality technology </span><span class="italic">products</span><span class="calibre_3">, something you can sell and run a business on.</span></p><p class="calibre_1">
</p><p id="filepos55616" class="calibre_18"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">Products and Product/Market Fit</span></span></p><p class="calibre_11"><span class="calibre_3">Just because we've invested the time and effort to create a robust product does not mean anyone will want to buy it. So, in the product world, we strive to achieve </span><span class="italic">product/market fit</span><span class="calibre_3">.</span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">This is the smallest possible actual </span><span class="italic">product</span><span class="calibre_3"> that meets the needs of a specific </span><span class="italic">market</span><span class="calibre_3"> of customers. Marc Andreessen is credited with popularizing this all‐important concept, and it is a major focus of this book.</span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">And just to be clear, since these are actual products, they are the result of </span><span class="italic">delivery</span><span class="calibre_3">. The discovery activities help us determine the necessary product, but it is delivery that actually does the work necessary to build, test, and release the product.</span></p><p class="calibre_1">
</p><p id="filepos56759" class="calibre_18"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">Product Vision</span></span></p><p class="calibre_11"><span class="calibre_3">The final critical concept is </span><span class="italic">product vision</span><span class="calibre_3">. This refers to the longer‐term objective of this product, normally 2–10 years out. It is how we as a product organization intend to deliver on the company's mission.</span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">So, we use </span><span class="italic">prototypes</span><span class="calibre_3"> to conduct rapid experiments in product discovery, and then in delivery, we build and release </span><span class="italic">products</span><span class="calibre_3"> in hopes of achieving </span><span class="italic">product/market fit</span><span class="calibre_3">, which is a key step on the way to delivering on the company's </span><span class="italic">product vision</span><span class="calibre_3">.</span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">Now don't worry if you're hazy on any of these concepts. I know you likely have many questions, but they'll hopefully become clear as we dive deeper into each topic. It's also normal to be a little skeptical—“How can I possibly run 15 of these experiments in a week?”</span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">I warned you that strong product teams work nothing like most teams, and this should give you your first taste of how different things can be.</span></p><blockquote class="calibre_21">
</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">Minimum Viable Product</span></span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_22">
</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_17"><span class="calibre_3">The concept of </span><span class="italic">minimum viable product</span><span class="calibre_3"> (MVP) is one of the most important concepts in the product world. It has been around for many years. The term was coined by Frank Robinson (in 2001), and I wrote about the concept in the first edition of this book (in 2008). It was popularized, however, in the book </span><span class="italic">The Lean Startup</span><span class="calibre_3"> by Eric Ries in 2011.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_17"><span class="calibre_3">Eric's book did a great deal to help product teams, and to me, it is a must‐read book for all product people. But I think most people would likely admit that the concept of MVP has caused considerable confusion within product teams, and I spend a lot of my time helping teams get value out of this critical concept.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_17"><span class="calibre_3">The vast majority of times I meet a team that has been working hard to create an MVP I am able to convince them that they could have achieved the same learning in a fraction of the time and effort. They have spent literally months building an MVP when they could have had this same learning in days or, sometimes, even in hours.</span><a></a></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_17"><span class="calibre_3">The other unhappy consequence is that very often the rest of the company—especially key leadership in sales and marketing—is confused and embarrassed by what the product team is trying to get customers to buy and use.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_17"><span class="calibre_3">While this is partly a result of the way most people have learned this concept, I think the root of the issue is that while the P in MVP stands for </span><span class="italic">product</span><span class="calibre_3">, an MVP should </span><span class="italic">never</span><span class="calibre_3"> be an actual product (where product is defined as something that your developers can release with confidence, that your customers can run their business on, and that you can sell and support).</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_17"><span class="calibre_3">The MVP should be a </span><span class="italic">prototype</span><span class="calibre_3">, not a product.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_17"><span class="calibre_3">Building an actual product‐quality deliverable to learn, even if that deliverable has minimal functionality, leads to substantial waste of time and money, which of course is the antithesis of Lean.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_17"><span class="calibre_3">I find that using the more general term </span><span class="italic">prototype</span><span class="calibre_3"> makes this critical point clear to the product team, the company, and the prospective customers.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_17"><span class="calibre_3">So, in this book, I talk about different types of </span><span class="italic">prototypes</span><span class="calibre_3"> being used in discovery and </span><span class="italic">products</span><span class="calibre_3"> being produced in delivery.</span></blockquote><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_9"></div>
