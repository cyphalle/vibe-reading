For complicated product efforts, it often helps to have some way to scope out and plan your discovery efforts.</span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">In this section, I describe two of my favorite discovery‐planning techniques.

I attribute much of the success in my own career to this technique.</span><a></a></p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_50"></div>
