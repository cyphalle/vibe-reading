</p><p id="filepos299067" class="calibre_18"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">Overview</span></span></p><p class="calibre_11"><span class="calibre_3">Most of us are working on solving some pretty hard problems, and it usually ends up taking some fairly complex systems to power these solutions. For most teams, there are two very significant challenges to tackle.</span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">First, discovering in detail what the customer solution needs to be. That includes everything from making sure there are enough customers that even need this solution (the demand) and then coming up with a solution that works for our customers and for our business.</span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">Even harder, we need to make sure we come up with a </span><span class="italic">single solution</span><span class="calibre_3"> that works for </span><span class="italic">many</span><span class="calibre_3"> customers, and not a series of </span><span class="italic">specials</span><span class="calibre_3">. To do this, we need to be able to test out many ideas, and we need to do this quickly and inexpensively.</span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">Second, we need to ensure we deliver a robust and scalable implementation that our customers can depend on for consistently reliable value. Your team needs to be able to </span><span class="italic">release with confidence</span><span class="calibre_3">. While you'll never have 100 percent confidence, you should not have to release and pray.</span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">So, we need to learn fast, yet also release with confidence.</span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">It's understandable that many people might naturally view these two difficult goals as at odds with each other. We are in a big hurry to push something out to learn what works and what doesn't. Yet, we don't want to release something that's not ready for prime time and risk hurting our customers and damaging our brand.</span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">I spend a lot of my time visiting with product teams. I have on occasion been called out for pushing hard one minute for the team to be much more aggressive in getting out to customers and getting early feedback on their ideas, and then just minutes later pushing that same team hard not to compromise their standards on releasing scalable, fault‐tolerant, reliable, high‐performance, secure software.</span><a></a></p><blockquote class="calibre_4"><span class="italic">We need to learn fast, yet also release with confidence.</span></blockquote><p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre_3">You might also recognize this problem in another guise. Many teams get into a lot of grief with the concept of a minimum viable product (MVP) because on the one hand we are very motivated to get this out in front of customers fast to get feedback and learn. And, on the other hand, when we do get out there fast, people feel like this so‐called product is an embarrassment to the brand and the company. How could we possibly consider launching this?</span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">In this section, I clarify how strong teams work to meet these dual and simultaneous objectives of rapid learning in discovery, yet building stable and solid releases in delivery.</span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">In general, I find that most product teams have a much better sense of how to accomplish the second goal of delivering solid software than how to accomplish the first goal of rapid experimentation and discovery. Continuous delivery is a good example of an advanced delivery technique I find in teams that understand the importance of a series of small, incremental changes to a complex system.</span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">Part of what causes confusion is a dilution of what is really meant when we call something a “product” or “product‐quality” or “productized” or “live in production.”</span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">I always try hard to reserve the term </span><span class="italic">product</span><span class="calibre_3"> to describe the state at which we can run a business on it. Specifically, it is scalable and performant to the degree necessary. It has a strong suite of automated regression tests. It is instrumented to collect the necessary analytics. It has been internationalized and localized where appropriate. It is maintainable. It is consistent with the brand promise. And, most important, it is something the team can release with confidence.</span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">This is not easy—it's where most of the time goes when our engineers are building. As such, we try very hard not to waste this effort.</span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">Doing all this work when the product manager isn't even sure this is the solution the customer wants or needs is a recipe for product failure and big waste. So, the purpose of product discovery is to make sure we have some evidence that when we ask the engineers to build a production‐quality product, it won't be a wasted effort. And, this is why we have so many different techniques in product discovery.</span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">We've got techniques for getting a much deeper understanding of our users and customers, and for validating product ideas both qualitatively and quantitatively. And, in fact, most of the techniques don't require the developer's time (which is important, because we appreciate how much time and effort needs to go into creating production‐quality software in delivery).</span><a></a></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">Much of the key to effective product discovery is getting access to our customers without trying to push our quick experiments into production.</span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">If you are an early stage startup and you have no customers, then of course this is not really an issue (and it's very likely premature to even be creating production‐quality software).</span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">But, for most of us, we have real customers and real revenue, so we do have to care about this. Later in this section, we'll talk about the techniques that allow for rapid experimentation in a responsible way in larger, enterprise companies.</span><a></a></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">But here's the key. If you want to </span><span class="italic">discover</span><span class="calibre_3"> great products, it really is essential that you get your ideas in front of real users and customers early and often.</span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">If you want to </span><span class="italic">deliver</span><span class="calibre_3"> great products, you want to use best practices for engineering and try not to override the engineers' concerns.</span></p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_43"></div>
