</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">We've explored product teams in </span><a href="index_split_010.html#filepos61676"><span class="calibre_6">Part Two</span></a><span class="calibre_3">, and we described how to decide what each team needs to focus on in </span><a href="index_split_026.html#filepos219297"><span class="calibre_6">Part Three</span></a><span class="calibre_3">. In </span><a href="#filepos296950"><span class="calibre_6">Part Four</span></a><span class="calibre_3">, I explain how product teams do their job. We'll work through the techniques, activities, and best practices used to repeatedly discover and deliver successful products.</span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">Even though this part is titled “The Right Process,” I hope you'll soon realize that the right process is not any </span><span class="italic">single</span><span class="calibre_3"> process. Rather, it's more accurately described as a combination of techniques, mindset, and culture.</span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">I mostly emphasize discovery techniques, as our focus is on product managers, and that is their primary responsibility.</span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">The bulk of the product manager's time needs to be focused on working with her product team, with her key stakeholders, and with her customers to discover solutions that her customers love and that work for the business.</span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre_3">Keep in mind, however, that the product manager and product designer do need to ensure that they're available to answer questions from the engineers that arise during delivery activities. Normally, answering these delivery questions is on the order of half an hour to an hour of time per day.</span><a></a></p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_42"></div>
